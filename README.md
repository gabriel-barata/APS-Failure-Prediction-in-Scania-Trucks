# APS-Failure-Prediction-in-Scania-Trucks

This repository is a machine learning project that tries to predict the failure on APS (Air Pressure System) in Scania trucks on goal to minimize maitainance costs for companys. Its composed by two notebook :
- DATA_PRE_PROCESS.ipynb : contains all the work done on the data to discover what features and algorithm's hyper-parameters that would have the best results.
- APS_FAILURE_PREDICTION_ON_SCANIA_TRUCKS.ipynb : summarized notebook with important descriptions and models results.
